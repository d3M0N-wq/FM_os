# FM_os
Created own os with the use of Cosmos utility tool.

Creatred a full Working os with file system and ,multi- user support.

As we all know that there are many functions of an os including both external that is visible to user as well as internal that runs and processes at the background interacting with the cpu that is hidden from the user .

Here we selected some of its functions that is visible to the user and managed by the user And also we found it somewhat easy to perform and implement in our os.

Advantages:-
• Allows many different users to take advantage of computer's resources simultaneously

• It is used as a single server and multiple number of clients- The time shared system allows multiple users to share the system 
simultaneously

• The system switches from one user to another rapidly, giving the impression that each user has full control of the system

• Store the information about the number of user’s connected to the server and provides security to data from unauthorized access

• Each user has a private set of programs and access techniques for accessing the data.
